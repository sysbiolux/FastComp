# FastComp
This repository contains the FastComp algorithm for subcellular localisation prediction of metabolic reactions.

## Algorithm properties
* LP approximation of a MILP to determine reaction activity, the MILP is formulated in [1]

## Requisites
Two versions of fastComp exist:
A Version directly accessing cplex  and using the original fastcore algoirthm from [2] (used in the paper) and a version using the solve commands provided by the COBRA Toolbox[3].
If you use the former, make sure, that you have cplex installed and set up on the matlab path.
If you use the latter, make sure to use a compatible COBRA Toolbox version (a few functions might not yet be added to the toolbox depending on your time of usage. If you use this version:
https://github.com/tpfau/cobratoolbox/tree/batchAdd2) all functions should be working.


## Repository structure
* src contains the source files with CalculateCompartments the script that has to be run to assign reactions and create a model wih localisations.
* src/Comparison contains all scripts necessary to run the different models along with the corresponding data. 
* Decompartmentalisation contains the scripts used for decompartmentalisation.
* Evaluation contains the scritps used to create the Results figures (without the actual data).
All scripts in src are documented in the Standard COBRA Toolbox format.
