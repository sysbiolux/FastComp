%
% INPUTS:
%    model:                 the original uncompartmentalised model (or split between cytosol and external). 
%                           The model must (with any added Exchanger) must be able to carry positive flux in all reactions. 
%    cytosolID:             the string for the cytosol id (just the letter no enclosing brackets) 
%    CompartmentIDs:        a cell array of letters for the compartments that shall be predicted. 
%    ReactionLocalisation:  A Cell Array of Cell Arrays containing one or more 
%                           Strings indicating compartments one entry for all reactions in the model. (e.g. {{'c','m'};{'c'};{'p','x'}})
%                           Either ReactionCompartmentalisationData or GeneCompartmentalisationData 
%                           need to be provided.
%    GeneLocalisation:      A Cell array of cell arrays with localisations for each gene. 
%                           The following assumption is made wrt activity of a reaction:
%                           all unlocalised genes are assumed to be present in all compartments.
%                           all localised genes are assumed to only be present in the indicated compartment.
%                           only reactions for which the gpr rule evaluates to true under these conditions are assumed to be in the respective compartment. 
%    SingleCompModel:       Indicator whether this is a single compartment model (only cytosol) or if it has external reactions
%    ExternalID:            ID of the external Compartment 
%    Exchangers:            List of Exchangers for the model including Demand and uptake reactions.  
%                           This is a n x 5 cell array with the first element being the
%                           metabolite(without compartment) the second element is the compartment ID
%                           The third element is the stoichiometric coefficient 
%                           The fourth and fifth elementes are the lower and upper bound respectively.
%    useMO:                 Whether to run the Mintz-Oron algorithm or not.
%    
% OUTPUTS:
%    FCComps:               The Predicted compartments for the consistency
%                           based prediction
%    FCtime:                The runtime for the consistency based prediction
%    FullComps:             The Predicted compartments for fastComp
%    Fulltime:              The runtime for fastcomp
%    MOComps:               The Predicted compartments for the Mintz Oron MILP
%    MOTime:                The runtime of the MIntz-Oron MILP
